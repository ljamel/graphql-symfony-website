Getting started
---------------

First you'll need to get the source of the project. Do this by cloning the
whole Graphene-SQLAlchemy repository:

```bash
# Get the example project code
git clone https://github.com/ljamel/graphq-symfony-website.git
cd graphq-symfony-website
```

Add dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

Now start the server:

```bash
symfony server:run
```


Now head on over to
http://127.0.0.1:8000
